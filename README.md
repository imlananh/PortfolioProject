# 🦠 COVID-19 Data Exploration and Visualization Project
## This project explores global COVID-19 data using SQL and visualizes key insights with Tableau. The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and includes two CSV files:
- CovidDeaths.csv
- CovidVaccinations.csv

### 📊 Objective
- The main goals of this project were to:
- Clean and transform raw COVID-19 data with SQL
- Analyze key indicators such as infection rates, death percentages, and vaccination trends
- Create meaningful visualizations to support data-driven storytelling

### 🛠️ Tools Used
- SQL Server — for data exploration, transformation, and analysis
- Tableau — for data visualization and dashboards
- Kaggle Datasets — source of COVID-19 data
  
#### 📈 Visualization in Tableau
After completing the SQL analysis, I built interactive dashboards in Tableau to visualize:
- Global Numbers
- Total Deaths Per Country
- Percent Population Infected
- Percent Population Infected Per Country
